# Music-Recommender-System
This project aims to build a music recommender system that suggests songs to users based on their listening history, preferences, and the similarity of the songs' audio features using Machine Learning classification algorithms and libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch for content-based filtering and deep learning, behavioral patterns and NLP for collaborative-based filtering.

## Data
The data used in this project is a combination of user listening history, song information, and audio features of the songs. The data includes information such as song title, artist, album, genre, popularity, and audio features like tempo, energy, and valence.

## Methods
The music recommender system is built using a hybrid approach, where the system suggests songs to users based on both collaborative filtering and content-based filtering. Collaborative filtering is based on the listening history of similar users, while content-based filtering is based on the similarity of the songs' audio features and the user's preferences. Machine Learning classification algorithms such as TensorFlow and PyTorch are used for deep learning and NLP to improve the performance of the content-based filtering. Behavioral patterns are also extracted from the user's listening history to improve the performance of collaborative-based filtering.

## Results
The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, and mean average precision. The results show the effectiveness of the hybrid approach in suggesting relevant songs to users.

## Usage
The code for this project is written in Python and uses the following libraries:

Pandas
Numpy
Scikit-learn
TensorFlow
PyTorch
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
To run the code, clone the repository and run the jupyter notebook Music_Recommender_System.ipynb. The data used in the project is included in the data file.

Conclusion
The music recommender system can be used to suggest relevant songs to users based on their listening history, preferences, and the similarity of the songs' audio features. This project demonstrates how to build a music recommender system using a hybrid approach of collaborative filtering and content-based filtering, and using Machine Learning classification algorithms such as TensorFlow and PyTorch for deep learning and NLP, for collaborative-based filtering.
